## Current Integration: Share on LinkedIn API

### Status: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Overview
StoryScale is currently integrated with LinkedIn's **Share on LinkedIn API** (Default Tier), which enables basic posting functionality to LinkedIn profiles.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- **Flow**: Authorization Code Grant
- **Scopes**: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `w_member_social`
- **Security**: CSRF protection with state parameter, secure cookie storage
- **Implementation**:
  - `/app/api/auth/linkedin/authorize/route.ts` - Initiates OAuth flow
  - `/app/api/auth/linkedin/callback/route.ts` - Handles callback and token exchange

#### 2. LinkedIn Account Connection
- **Location**: Settings page (`/app/settings`)
- **Features**:
  - One-click connection to LinkedIn
  - Visual connection status indicator in sidebar
  - Profile information storage (name, email, picture)
  - Person URN storage for posting

#### 3. Post to LinkedIn
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/linkedin/post`
- **Features**:
  - Publish posts directly to LinkedIn from DraftEditor
  - Text-only posts (no media support in current tier)
  - Public visibility posts
  - Automatic draft status update to "posted"
  - LinkedIn post ID tracking
- **Implementation**: `/components/DraftEditor.tsx`

#### 4. Token Management
- **Storage**: Firebase Firestore (`users/{userId}/integrations/linkedin`)
- **Expiration Tracking**: Token expiry validation before posting
- **Refresh**: Manual reconnection required when token expires
