# Security Incident Report - API Key Exposure

## Date: 2025-10-01

## Incident
`.env.local` file containing sensitive API keys was accidentally committed to GitHub repository in commit `fb8158a`.

## Exposed Keys
The following sensitive credentials were exposed:
- ✅ Firebase API keys (public)
- ✅ Firebase Admin service account credentials
- ✅ Anthropic API key
- ✅ Stripe API keys (publishable and secret)
- ✅ Stripe webhook secret

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate Firebase Admin Credentials
- Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Navigate to Project Settings → Service Accounts
- Click "Generate New Private Key"
- Update `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL`, and `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID` in Vercel environment variables
- Delete the old service account from IAM

### 2. Rotate Anthropic API Key
- Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Navigate to API Keys
- Delete the exposed key
- Create a new API key
- Update `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables

### 3. Rotate Stripe Keys
- Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
- Navigate to Developers → API Keys
- Roll the secret key
- Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
- Navigate to Developers → Webhooks
- Delete the existing webhook endpoint
- Create a new webhook endpoint
- Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables

### 4. Update Vercel Environment Variables
After rotating all keys:
- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/)
- Navigate to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Update all rotated keys
- Redeploy the application

### 5. Monitor for Unauthorized Usage
- Check Firebase Authentication logs for suspicious sign-ins
- Check Anthropic API usage for unexpected activity
- Check Stripe dashboard for unauthorized transactions
- Review Firestore for any unauthorized data access

## Remediation Completed
- [x] Removed `.env.local` from git tracking (commit `71fa2e9`)
- [ ] Rotated Firebase Admin credentials
- [ ] Rotated Anthropic API key
- [ ] Rotated Stripe keys
- [ ] Updated Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Redeployed application
- [ ] Monitored services for unauthorized usage

## Prevention Measures
- `.env.local` is properly excluded in `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` provides template for required environment variables
- Consider using GitHub's secret scanning alerts for future protection
- Review pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental credential commits

## Notes
- Firebase client-side API keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) are safe to expose as they're meant to be public
- The critical keys to rotate are: Firebase Admin credentials, Anthropic API key, and Stripe secret keys

**Status:** ⚠️ URGENT - Keys need to be rotated immediately
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Security Issue
